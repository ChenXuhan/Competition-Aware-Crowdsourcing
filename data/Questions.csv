Body,"I want to use a track-bar to change a form's opacity.
This is my code:
decimal trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000;
this.Opacity = trans;
When I try to build it, I get this error:
  Cannot implicitly convert type 'decimal' to 'double'.
I tried making trans a double, but then the control doesn't work. This code has worked fine for me in VB.NET in the past. 
","I have an absolutely positioned div containing several children, one of which is a relatively positioned div. When I use a percentage-based width on the child div, it collapses to '0' width on Internet&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;7, but not on Firefox or Safari.
If I use pixel width, it works. If the parent is relatively positioned, the percentage width on the child works.
Is there something I'm missing here?
Is there an easy fix for this besides the pixel-based width on the
child?
Is there an area of the CSS specification that covers this?

","How do you expose a LINQ query as an ASMX web service? Usually, from the business tier, I can return a typed DataSet or DataTable which can be serialized for transport over ASMX.
How can I do the same for a LINQ query? Is there a way to populate a typed DataSet or DataTable via a LINQ query?: 
public static MyDataTable CallMySproc()    
{    
    string conn = ...;
    MyDatabaseDataContext db = new MyDatabaseDataContext(conn);    
    MyDataTable dt = new MyDataTable();
    // execute a sproc via LINQ
    var query = from dr in db.MySproc().AsEnumerable
    select dr;
    // copy LINQ query resultset into a DataTable -this does not work !    
    dt = query.CopyToDataTable();
    return dt;
}
How can I get the resultset of a LINQ query into a DataSet or DataTable? Alternatively, is the LINQ query serializeable so that I can expose it as an ASMX web service?

","Solutions are welcome in any language. :-) I'm looking for the fastest way to obtain the value of ?, as a personal challenge. More specifically I'm using ways that don't involve using #defined constants like M_PI, or hard-coding the number in.
The program below tests the various ways I know of. The inline assembly version is, in theory, the fastest option, though clearly not portable; I've included it as a baseline to compare the other versions against. In my tests, with built-ins, the 4 * atan(1) version is fastest on GCC 4.2, because it auto-folds the atan(1) into a constant. With -fno-builtin specified, the atan2(0, -1) version is fastest.
Here's the main testing program (pitimes.c):
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;
#define ITERS 10000000
#define TESTWITH(x) {                                                       \
    diff = 0.0;                                                             \
    time1 = clock();                                                        \
    for (i = 0; i &lt; ITERS; ++i)                                             \
        diff += (x) - M_PI;                                                 \
    time2 = clock();                                                        \
    printf(""%s\t=&gt; %e, time =&gt; %f\n"", #x, diff, diffclock(time2, time1));   \
}
static inline double
diffclock(clock_t time1, clock_t time0)
{
    return (double) (time1 - time0) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
}
int
main()
{
    int i;
    clock_t time1, time2;
    double diff;
    /* Warmup. The atan2 case catches GCC's atan folding (which would
     * optimise the ``4 * atan(1) - M_PI'' to a no-op), if -fno-builtin
     * is not used. */
    TESTWITH(4 * atan(1))
    TESTWITH(4 * atan2(1, 1))
#if defined(__GNUC__) &amp;&amp; (defined(__i386__) || defined(__amd64__))
    extern double fldpi();
    TESTWITH(fldpi())
#endif
    /* Actual tests start here. */
    TESTWITH(atan2(0, -1))
    TESTWITH(acos(-1))
    TESTWITH(2 * asin(1))
    TESTWITH(4 * atan2(1, 1))
    TESTWITH(4 * atan(1))
    return 0;
}
And the inline assembly stuff (fldpi.c), noting that it will only work for x86 and x64 systems:
double
fldpi()
{
    double pi;
    asm(""fldpi"" : ""=t"" (pi));
    return pi;
}
And a build script that builds all the configurations I'm testing (build.sh):
#!/bin/sh
gcc -O3 -Wall -c           -m32 -o fldpi-32.o fldpi.c
gcc -O3 -Wall -c           -m64 -o fldpi-64.o fldpi.c
gcc -O3 -Wall -ffast-math  -m32 -o pitimes1-32 pitimes.c fldpi-32.o
gcc -O3 -Wall              -m32 -o pitimes2-32 pitimes.c fldpi-32.o -lm
gcc -O3 -Wall -fno-builtin -m32 -o pitimes3-32 pitimes.c fldpi-32.o -lm
gcc -O3 -Wall -ffast-math  -m64 -o pitimes1-64 pitimes.c fldpi-64.o -lm
gcc -O3 -Wall              -m64 -o pitimes2-64 pitimes.c fldpi-64.o -lm
gcc -O3 -Wall -fno-builtin -m64 -o pitimes3-64 pitimes.c fldpi-64.o -lm
Apart from testing between various compiler flags (I've compared 32-bit against 64-bit too, because the optimisations are different), I've also tried switching the order of the tests around. The atan2(0, -1) version still comes out top every time, though.
